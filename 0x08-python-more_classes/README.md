# Python - More Classes and Objects
This directory contains the script files of the second part of Classes and Objects. 

The idea is to understand with more clarity the different sides and possible solution to possible challenges that may occur when dealing with Classes or objects in Python.

## Concepts
* Understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Differenciating between private and public instance attributes
* Differenciating between private and public instance methods
* Understading `repr()`, `str()`, `eval()` and more builtin functions

# JavaScript - Web jQuery
This directory contains the code or script of the implementation of this JavaScript - Web jQuery project.

## Introduction
This project delves in JQuery concepts and applications.
Since the appearance of dynamic content, JavaScript has gain much population and interesting features and packages have been developed to diversify its usability.
In this project, JQuery is the focus.

## Features
The aim is to implement the following:
* Update the look or content based on an action
* Display data from an `API`

## Usage
This project is purely front-end. The use of a browser such as chrome 57.0 is needed. (Other versions might work as well)

All files are `.js` files and require their `.html` files(Do well to create you own `.html` files if not provided).

In your `.html` file, insert the following tags
```js
    ...
    <body>
        <head>
            <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script>
        </head>
        ...
        <script type="text/javascript" src="[jsfile]"></script>
    </body>
    ...
```
* *jsfile: the name of the `.js` file you may want to run at that point*

Example
```js
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <title>Holberton School</title>
            <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script>
        </head>
        <body>
            <header> 
                First HTML page
            </header>
            <footer>
                Holberton School - 2017
            </footer>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="0-script.js"></script>
        </body>
    </html>
```

## How to run
With the help of a browser, launch your `.html` file and the JavaScript/JQuery will take effect(if the linkage has taken place properly).

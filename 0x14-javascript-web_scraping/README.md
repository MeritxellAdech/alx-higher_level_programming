# JavaScript - Web scraping
This directory contains the code for this project.

## Introductory
This project focuses on the implementation of the extraction of data from a website.

## Requirements
The following are needed to run the files
1. Install Node 14
```python
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

2. Install `semi-standard`
```python
    sudo npm install semistandard --global
```

3. Install `request` module and use it
```python
    sudo npm install request --global
    export NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules
```
*Notes: Request module has been deprecated since February 2020 - the team is considering alternative to replace this module - however, itâ€™s a really simple and powerful module for practicing web-scraping in JavaScript (and still used a lot in the industry).*


## Usage
All files are executable
1. `./filename.js` to run the file
    *filename.js: is the name of the file you want to run*
    * Depending on the file you are running, additional arguments should be provided
